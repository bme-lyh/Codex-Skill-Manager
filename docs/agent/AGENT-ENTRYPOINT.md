# Agent entry point

Codex Skill Manager (CSM) is a local-first Windows application for discovering,
installing, updating, auditing, quarantining and restoring Codex skills.

Agents should prefer `csm --json` and treat every mutating operation as a
two-step workflow:

1. prepare or inspect the intended change;
2. apply it only after the user has approved the exact skills and any accepted
   high-risk findings.

Never edit `sources.lock.json` or `state.db` directly. Never delete skill
directories. `remove` means a reversible move into quarantine. The `.system`
directory is protected and cannot be managed.

Start with:

```powershell
csm doctor --json
csm dashboard --json
csm audit --json
```

Read [command-contracts.md](command-contracts.md),
[transaction-model.md](transaction-model.md), and
[security-policy.md](security-policy.md) before automating mutations.
